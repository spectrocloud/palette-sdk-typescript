            Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

            The serialization format is:

            <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
              (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
            <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
              (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
            <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
              (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
            <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>

            No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

            When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

            Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
              a. No precision is lost
              b. No fractional digits will be emitted
              c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
            The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

            Examples:
              1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
              1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

            Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

            Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

            This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:\<index>', where \<index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

            Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

            The serialization format is:

            <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
              (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
            <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
              (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
            <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
              (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
            <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>

            No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

            When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

            Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
              a. No precision is lost
              b. No fractional digits will be emitted
              c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
            The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

            Examples:
              1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
              1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

            Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

            Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

            This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

            Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

            The serialization format is:

            <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
              (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
            <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
              (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
            <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
              (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
            <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>

            No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

            When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

            Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
              a. No precision is lost
              b. No fractional digits will be emitted
              c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
            The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

            Examples:
              1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
              1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

            Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

            Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

            This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

          description: |-
            DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

      description: |-
        Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

        The serialization format is:

        <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
          (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
        <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
          (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
        <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
          (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
        <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>

        No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

        When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

        Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
          a. No precision is lost
          b. No fractional digits will be emitted
          c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
        The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

        Examples:
          1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
          1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

        Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

        Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)

        This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.
